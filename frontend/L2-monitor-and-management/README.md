# UniFi Monitor & Management Frontend

A comprehensive admin dashboard for monitoring and managing L1 and L2 contracts, as well as block information for the UniFi OP Stack chain.

## Features

### Block Monitor
- **Real-time block tracking** across multiple RPC endpoints
- **Multi-endpoint support**: Configure multiple RPC endpoints in `src/utils/rpc.ts`
- **Block tags**: Query `unsafe`, `safe`, and `finalized` blocks
- **Auto-refresh**: 5-second refresh interval for real-time updates
- **Block details**: Number, hash, timestamp, transaction count, miner, gas info

### Predeploys Management
- **Query predeploy contract info**: View owner/admin, implementation address, balance, and status
- **Filter by category**:
  - Bridge & Messaging
  - Fee Vaults
  - Factories
  - System Contracts
  - Governance & Attestation
- **Management features** (for manageable contracts):
  - **Transfer Admin/Owner**: Transfer proxy admin or contract ownership
    - For ProxyAdmin: Transfer ownership directly
    - For ProxyAdmin-managed contracts: Change admin via ProxyAdmin contract
  - **Upgrade Implementation**: Upgrade contract implementation via ProxyAdmin
  - **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw ETH from vault contracts
- **Smart ProxyAdmin routing**:
  - Automatically detects if contract is managed by ProxyAdmin (0x4200...0018)
  - Routes admin transfer and upgrade calls through ProxyAdmin contract
  - Generates appropriate calldata for multisig/DAO execution
- **Smart authorization handling**:
  - If owner is an EOA: Check wallet connection
  - If owner is a contract (multisig, DAO): Present calldata for transaction crafting

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- A compatible Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as a template):

```bash
# L1 RPC URL for L1 contract interactions
REACT_APP_L1_RPC_URL=https://your-l1-rpc-url

# L2 RPC URL for L2 contract interactions
REACT_APP_L2_RPC_URL=http://your-l2-rpc-url

# Block Monitor RPC Endpoints
REACT_APP_GATEWAY_RPC_URL=https://your-gateway-rpc-url
REACT_APP_MAIN_NODE_RPC_URL=http://your-main-node-rpc-url
REACT_APP_TEE_NODE_RPC_URL=http://your-tee-node-rpc-url
```

2. **Wagmi Configuration**: Edit `src/config/wagmi.ts` to update:
- Chain ID (currently set to 1337)
- RPC endpoints
- Chain details

3. **Predeploy Contracts**: Edit `src/config/predeploys.ts` to add/remove predeploy contracts:

```typescript
{
  name: 'ContractName',
  address: '0x...',
  description: 'Description of what this contract does',
  category: 'bridge' | 'vault' | 'factory' | 'system' | 'governance',
  isManageable: true | false,
}
```

### Running the Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Wagmi 2** - Wallet integration and smart contract interactions
- **Viem 2** - Ethereum client library
- **React Router 6** - Navigation
- **TanStack React Query 5** - Data fetching and caching
- **CSS3** - Styling (no framework, pure CSS)

## Key Utilities

### RPC Utilities (`src/utils/rpc.ts`)
- `getBlockByTag()` - Fetch block by tag (unsafe, safe, finalized)
- `fetchBlockData()` - Fetch multiple blocks at once
- `RPC_ENDPOINTS` - List of all configured RPC endpoints

### Contract Utilities (`src/utils/contracts.ts`)
- `getContractOwner()` - Get owner/admin address of a contract (handles ProxyAdmin specially)
- `getImplementation()` - Get implementation address of a proxy contract
- `getBalance()` - Get ETH balance of an address
- `getContractInfo()` - Get owner, implementation, and balance info
- `getViewFunctionData()` - Fetch view function results from contracts
- `generateTransferOwnershipCalldata()` - Generate calldata for ownership transfer
- `generateChangeProxyAdminCalldata()` - Generate calldata for ProxyAdmin.changeProxyAdmin()
- `generateUpgradeCalldata()` - Generate calldata for ProxyAdmin.upgrade()
- `generateWithdrawCalldata()` - Generate calldata for withdraw function
- `isValidAddress()` - Validate Ethereum address format

## Usage

### Block Monitor
1. Navigate to the "Block Monitor" tab
2. View blocks across all three RPC endpoints
3. See real-time block data updated every 5 seconds
4. Click on block details to see expanded information

### Manage Predeploys
1. Navigate to the "Predeploys" tab
2. Connect your wallet using the wallet connection button
3. Filter contracts by category or show only manageable ones
4. View contract information:
   - Owner/Admin address (with visual indicator if you own it)
   - Implementation address (for proxy contracts)
   - Balance (for vault contracts)
   - Contract-specific view function data
5. Click action buttons to manage contracts:
   - **Transfer Owner/Admin**: Change contract ownership or admin
   - **Upgrade Impl**: Upgrade contract implementation (not available for ProxyAdmin)
   - **Withdraw**: Withdraw funds from vault contracts
6. For EOA owners:
   - Verify you are the owner (displayed on card)
   - Copy the calldata and execute the transaction from your wallet
7. For contract owners (multisig, DAO):
   - The calldata will be presented
   - Craft the transaction in your multisig/DAO interface using the provided calldata

## Management Actions

### Transfer Admin/Owner

#### For ProxyAdmin Contract
- **Button**: "Transfer Owner"
- **Target**: ProxyAdmin contract itself
- **Function**: `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`
- **Authorization**: Must be current owner (EOA or multisig)

#### For ProxyAdmin-Managed Contracts
- **Button**: "Transfer Admin"
- **Detection**: Automatically detects if admin is ProxyAdmin (0x4200...0018)
- **Target**: ProxyAdmin contract
- **Function**: `changeProxyAdmin(address proxy, address newAdmin)`
- **Authorization**: Must be ProxyAdmin owner (EOA or multisig)

#### For Other Contracts
- **Button**: "Transfer Admin"
- **Target**: Contract itself
- **Function**: `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`
- **Authorization**: Must be current owner (EOA or multisig)

### Upgrade Implementation
- **Available for**: All manageable contracts except ProxyAdmin
- **Detection**: Automatically detects if contract is managed by ProxyAdmin
- **Target**: ProxyAdmin contract
- **Function**: `upgrade(address proxy, address implementation)`
- **Authorization**: Must be ProxyAdmin owner (EOA or multisig)
- **Input**: New implementation contract address

### Withdraw Funds
- **Available for**: Vault contracts (SequencerFeeVault, BaseFeeVault, L1FeeVault, OperatorFeeVault, UniFiFeeVault)
- **Function**: `withdraw()`
- **Authorization**: Must be current owner (EOA or multisig)
- **Action**: Withdraws all accumulated ETH to the configured recipient

### Authorization Handling
- **For EOA Owner**: Must be the connected wallet
- **For Contract Owner (multisig/DAO)**: Calldata provided for transaction crafting

## Notes

- No authorization is enforced by the frontend - it assumes the user has legitimate access
- The frontend provides guidance based on contract ownership (EOA vs contract)
- Always verify transaction details before executing
- Some contracts are read-only and cannot be managed (marked as `isManageable: false`)

## Development

### TypeScript
Strict mode is enabled. All components use proper typing.

### Adding New Predeploys
Edit `src/config/predeploys.ts`:

```typescript
{
  name: 'YourContract',
  address: '0x...',
  description: 'What this contract does',
  category: 'system',
  isManageable: false,
}
```

### Adding New RPC Endpoints
1. Add the environment variable to your `.env` file:
```bash
REACT_APP_YOUR_ENDPOINT_RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-url
```

2. Add validation and endpoint configuration in `src/utils/rpc.ts`:
```typescript
// Add validation
if (!process.env.REACT_APP_YOUR_ENDPOINT_RPC_URL) {
  throw new Error('REACT_APP_YOUR_ENDPOINT_RPC_URL is not set.');
}

// Add to RPC_ENDPOINTS array
export const RPC_ENDPOINTS: RpcEndpoint[] = [
  // ... existing endpoints
  {
    name: 'Your Endpoint',
    url: process.env.REACT_APP_YOUR_ENDPOINT_RPC_URL,
  },
];
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
